                    <p> “Robots Are Coming for Your Job Sooner Than You Think,” declared VICE in a September headline. Two months later, physicist Stephen Hawking said AI could be the “worst event in the history of our civilization.” What do we make of these proclamations: is this pragmatism, or doom-and-gloom? What do our concerns about robots say about our own humanity? What does it mean to consider post-humanity when the boundary of the “human” is unclear? How does this ambiguity translate to the sheer velocity at which AI and Machine Learning Models become more and more human-like for our own use? This course is taught on Tuesdays and Thursdays, at 9:30 to 10:45AM, with a lab every Thursday.</p>
                    <p>In How Human?, we examine the changing boundaries between artificial and real bodies through readings in studies of science and technology, feminist theories of embodiment, studies of race and ethnicity, posthumanism, futurism, and science fiction. Topics include the machine/human boundary, potential machine futures, the ethics of our technological present (and future), and an examination of our own hybrid existence. Our readings range from Masahiro Mori's Uncanny Valley to Lucy Suchman's Plans and Situated Actions to Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Simulation non-fiction. </p>
                    <p>We also participate in weekly a hands-on robotics lab and create our own robot with CircuitPython and Adafruit's Circuit Playground Express, or CPX. Ultrasonic sensors, light sensors, musical gloves, you name it, we can add it. As we create our robots, we take note of both the physical and mental process of our own creation becoming tangible and functional. At the end of the semester, our robots are to successfully go through a maze and tackle any obstacles it comes into contact with. This is the first iteration of this in-class lab experience within the Gallatin classroom, linking the gap between humanities and STEM education. This is an experimental course.</p>
